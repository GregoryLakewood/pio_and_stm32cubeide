; This is the root directory of the STM32CubeIDE project. Platformio can only
; take one source directory, thus we filter the sources using a
; source filter and additional build options to include the headers.
; Do not change this value
src_dir = ./
; The project headers are defined here to be available for the libraries as well
; Do not change this value
include_dir = Core/Inc

; This script adds all the needed source directories to the src_filter,
; the include directories to the build flags and all necessary other 
; build and linker flags. It will be executed before every build.
